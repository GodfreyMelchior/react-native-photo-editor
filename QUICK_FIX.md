# Quick Fix to Run the App

## The Problem
React Native 0.63.4 is old and has compatibility issues with:
- Java 17 (needs Java 11)
- Gradle 7+
- Android Gradle Plugin 7+

## EASIEST SOLUTION: Use Android Studio

1. **Open Android Studio**

2. **Open the project:**
   - File ‚Üí Open
   - Navigate to: `/Users/apple/Documents/React Native Projects/react-native-photo-editor/example/android`
   - Click "OK"

3. **Wait for Gradle sync** (2-3 minutes first time)

4. **Run the app:**
   - Click the green ‚ñ∂Ô∏è (Run) button at the top
   - OR: Right-click `app` folder ‚Üí Run 'app'

5. **Start Metro (in a separate terminal):**
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/apple/Documents/React Native Projects/react-native-photo-editor/example"
   npx react-native start
   ```

Android Studio will handle all the version conflicts automatically!

## ALTERNATIVE: Install Java 11

If you prefer command line:

### 1. Install Java 11 (run in background):
```bash
brew install openjdk@11
```

### 2. After installation, set Java 11 for this session:
```bash
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11)
java -version  # Should show 11.x.x
```

### 3. Then run the app:
```bash
cd "/Users/apple/Documents/React Native Projects/react-native-photo-editor/example"
npx react-native run-android
```

## WHAT I ALREADY FIXED

‚úÖ Created `local.properties` with Android SDK path
‚úÖ Fixed `configurations.compile` ‚Üí `configurations.implementation`
‚úÖ Set Gradle to 6.8.3 (compatible with React Native 0.63.4)
‚úÖ Set Android Gradle Plugin to 4.1.3

All the crop and rotate features are already implemented in the code!

## USE ANDROID STUDIO (RECOMMENDED!)

This is the **fastest and easiest** way. Android Studio will:
- Auto-download correct Gradle version
- Handle Java version compatibility
- Show build errors clearly
- Hot reload works perfectly

Just open the `android` folder in Android Studio and click Run! üöÄ
